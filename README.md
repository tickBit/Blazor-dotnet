# Blazor Server + ASP.NET Core + .NET 10 app

My first Blazor app.

- users can be registered to users
- logged in user can add, edit and view his/her notes
- user can delete his/her profile, a Bootstrap Modal is used to confirm the action

## Instructions - how to run

- For the first time:
  - install dependencies: `dotnet restore`
  - create database: `dotnet ef database update`

- Run the app:
  - `dotnet run`
